# Rock-Paper-Scissor
1. gather.py is used to collect data using opencv.
2. Using this I have made three different dataset namely rock, paper, scissor and none.
3. Next we are training our neural network on the gathered dataset using transfer learning Squeezenet.
6. We have trained our model for 10 epochs and have saved in .h5 file format. 
7. Now we are running rock-paper-scissors.ipynb file to run our model and execute this small game with computer in real time.
8. I have made two frame using open cv where one frame is used by user and another frame is used by computer. Winner of each game is dislayed on the screen.
